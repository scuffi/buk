# uk2buk

UK2BUK was designed to streamline the process of unfamiliar people navigating unfamiliar places. We hope to provide access to information and people that will help someone not from the area gain a better understanding of it. 

The main service is a social media like service where users can post any offerings of anything they are providing/giving, then they can be contacted by anyone in need of their offering to arrange further. It acts as a streamlined interaction between all the helping hands and people trying to sift through them.

The app is also entirely multilanguage (English & Ukrainian)
